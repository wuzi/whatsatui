# Native backend validation

Pinned dependency: `whatsapp-rust = 0.7.0`. Stable Rust 1.98.0, default backend features disabled (no nightly SIMD).

Automated adapter checks cover text/quote encoding, caller-assigned IDs, conservative send error classification, durability failure propagation, replay deduplication, bounded bridge backpressure, cancellation, group sender identity, captions, and supplied expiry metadata. These checks use synthetic data and local SQLite only.

Run the interactive probe yourself in a dedicated test directory:

```sh
cargo run --example backend_probe -- --data-dir /tmp/whatsapp-tui-probe
```

Scan the displayed QR from WhatsApp → Linked devices. Type `chats` for cached identities. `send CHAT_JID TEXT` and `reply CHAT_JID MESSAGE_ID SENDER_JID TEXT` transmit only in response to the command you type; use your own test conversations. `quit` flushes local state. The final application offers the same workflow through panes.

| Live exercise | Result | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pair, clean shutdown, restore session without scan | Not run | Requires user-operated account linking |
| Direct and existing group text, both directions | Not run | Requires user-operated test conversations |
| Quoted reply, stable IDs, receipt events | Not run | Requires linked account |
| Names, initial history, live/history deduplication | Not run | Requires linked account |
| Network interruption, reconnect, uncertain send reconciliation | Not run | Requires linked account and user-operated network interruption |

No automated tests or CI jobs send messages to contacts. Live release acceptance remains outstanding until this table is updated with actual observed results.

The upstream durability hook runs before acknowledgement for eligible inbound messages. Event-only placeholder recoveries follow the event ingestion path; newsletters are outside scope. Disk-full failures can also prevent upstream replay buffers from being written. Local transactions and idempotent replay improve recovery; they do not establish exactly-once end-to-end delivery. Never infer server acceptance solely from a locally persisted outgoing attempt.
